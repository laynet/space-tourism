## Overview

### The challenge

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Part of this was a tutorial from Kevin Powell. I wanted to get a better grasp on layout and using utility classes and after building this site I think I have that.

### Continued development

I would definitely like to rebuild this with react and sass
